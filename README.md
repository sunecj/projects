# Projects

**Title**: Optimization of storage automata

**Context**: An important part of Industry 4.0 automation is the efficient use of storage automata, i.e. automatic storage machines where production items can be stored and retrieved.
Storing and retrieving the items in the storage automat is a complex problem, and especially the time it takes to fetch and enter items is a factor.

**Problem**: Analysing and developing an algorithm for effecient storing and retrieving items in the storage automat.

**Method**: Analysing storage automata performance and current methods of storing and retrieving items. Research theoretical methods and algorithms. Implement an algorithm and test is on a concrete storage automat.

**Industry**: Yes. In collaboration with [Effimat A/S](https://effimat.com)

**Title**: Orchestration of Industry 4.0 production processes

**Context**: The SDU Software Engineering Section is currently building a software research platform for the production setup in the Industry 4.0 Lab. The platform integrates robots and other assets in the lab that makes up a production of e.g. a drone. The production sequence, i.e. the sequence of operations performed to produce the drone on different robots can be determined in many ways, e.g. centrally (planning) or decentrally (agent based).

**Problem**: Analyzing and developing a model for the orchestration of the production sequence

**Method**: Analyzing models for orchestration of production sequences and build a model for the I4.0 lab. Implement and test the model.

**Industry**: No. Collaboration with the SDU Industry 4.0 Laboratory

**Title**: AI and ML in high-level control and integration for Industry-4.0 and IIoT

**Context**: The SDU Software Engineering Section is currently building a software research platform for the production setup in the Industry 4.0 Lab. The platform integrates robots and other assets in the lab that makes up a production of e.g. a drone. One of the purposes of the platform is to collect data from assets and other sources in the system and present them to other application e.g. AI an ML applications, e.g. for analysis or dynamic configuration. 

**Problem**: How is data collected from the I4.0 lab and presented in a way that makes it useable by multiple applications 

**Method**: Analyse the the types of data and formats used in Industry 4.0 and build a model/api/implementation for the utilization of the data 

**Industry**: No. (but it might be possible to get one on board). Collaboration with the SDU Industry 4.0 Laboratory

**Title**: Micro services version control, configuration, deployment, and reliability 

**Context**: The SDU Software Engineering Section is currently building a software research platform for the production setup in the Industry 4.0 Lab. The platform integrates robots and other assets in the lab that makes up a production of e.g. a drone. The platform implements a service oriented architecture that is used in many contexts (collaboration, research and education) and configurations. It must be possible to deploy/redeploy specific configurations of software and hardware quickly and efficiently.

**Problem**: Is it possible to build a generally applicably model for configuration, deployment and reliability for the I4.0 Lab? 

**Method**: Analysis of version and configuration control, deployment (containerization, hardware types), and reliability to build a model for this. Implement and test the model in the I4.0 lab 

**Industry**: No. (but it might be possible to get one on board). Collaboration with the SDU Industry 4.0 Laboratory
