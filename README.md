**Title**: Optimization of storage automata

**Context**: An important part of Industry 4.0 automation is the efficient use of storage automata, i.e. automatic storage machines where production items can be stored and retrieved.
Storing and retrieving the items in the storage automat is a complex problem, and especially the time it takes to fetch and enter items is a factor.

**Problem**: Analysing and developing an algorithm for effecient storing and retrieving items in the storage automat.

**Method**: Analysing storage automata performance and current methods of storing and retrieving items. Research theoretical methods and algorithms. Implement an algorithm and test is on a concrete storage automat.

**Industry**: Yes. In collaboration with [Effimat A/S](https://effimat.com)
